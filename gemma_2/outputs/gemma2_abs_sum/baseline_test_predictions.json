      "question": "Psoriasis for past 7-8 years I had psoriasis on my scalp for nearly 10 years. Please give suggestions and medications.",
      "reference": "Psoriasis treatments reduce inflammation and clear the skin. Treatments can be divided into three main types: topical treatments, light therapy and systemic medications. Topical psoriasis treatments for mild to moderate psoriasis include corticosteroids as a short-term treatment during flares; creams or solutions containing vitamin D; anthralin to slow skin cell growth. Anthralin (Dritho-Scalp) can also remove scales and make skin smoother. But anthralin can irritate skin, and it stains almost anything it touches. It's usually applied for a short time and then washed off. Topical retinoids are vitamin A derivatives that may decrease inflammation, but also increase sensitivity to sunlight, which requires applying sunscreen before going outdoors. Calcineurin inhibitors tacrolimus (Prograf) and pimecrolimus (Elidel) reduce inflammation and plaque buildup.  Salicylic acid promotes sloughing of dead skin cells and reduces scaling. Sometimes it's combined with other medications, such as topical corticosteroids or coal tar, to increase its effectiveness. Salicylic acid is available in medicated shampoos and scalp solutions to treat scalp psoriasis. Coal tar reduces scaling, itching and inflammation. It is available in over-the-counter shampoos, creams and oils.  Coal tar can irritate the skin, has a strong odor and stains clothing and bedding.  Light therapy (phototherapy) uses natural sunlight or artificial ultraviolet light A (UVA) or ultraviolet B (UVB) light.  Some doctors combine UVB treatment and coal tar treatment, which is known as Goeckerman treatment.  Psoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA) involves taking a light-sensitizing medication (psoralen) before exposure to UVA light.   For severe psoriasis or psoriasis resistant to other types of treatment, your doctor may prescribe oral or injected drugs. This is known as systemic treatment. Because of severe side effects, some of these medications are used for only brief periods and may be alternated with other forms of treatment. These drugs include retinoids; methotrexate (Rheumatrex) that helps psoriasis by decreasing the production of skin cells and suppressing inflammation; cyclosporine (Gengraf, Neoral) that suppresses the immune system and is similar to methotrexate in effectiveness, but can only be taken short-term.  Drugs that alter the immune system (biologics) include etanercept (Enbrel), infliximab (Remicade), adalimumab (Humira), ustekinumab (Stelara), golimumab (Simponi), apremilast (Otezla), secukinumab (Cosentyx) and ixekizumab (Taltz). Most of these drugs are given by injection (apremilast is oral) and are usually used for people who have failed to respond to traditional therapy or who have associated psoriatic arthritis. Biologics must be used with caution because they have strong effects on the immune system and may permit life-threatening infections.  Thioguanine (Tabloid) and hydroxyurea (Droxia, Hydrea) are medications that can be used when other drugs can't be given.  A number of alternative therapies to ease the symptoms of psoriasis, including special diets, creams, dietary supplements and herbs, are deemed generally safe, and they may be helpful to some people in reducing signs and symptoms, such as itching and scaling.  Alternative therapies include aloe vera that may reduce redness, scaling, itching and inflammation; fish oil to reduce inflammation. Taking 3 grams or less of fish oil daily is generally recognized as safe, and you may find it beneficial. Oregon grape (barberry) may reduce inflammation and ease psoriasis symptoms.  Other measures that may help include daily baths to remove scales and calm inflamed skin. Add bath oil, colloidal oatmeal, Epsom salts or Dead Sea salts to the water and soak. Avoid hot water and harsh soaps, which can worsen symptoms; use lukewarm water and mild soaps that have added oils and fats. Soak about 10 minutes then gently pat dry skin. Use moisturizer. Expose your skin to small amounts of sunlight. Find out what triggers, if any, worsen your psoriasis and take steps to prevent or avoid them. Infections, injuries to your skin, stress, smoking and intense sun exposure can all worsen psoriasis. Avoid drinking alcohol.  If you do drink, keep it moderate.",

Other factors that can increase a woman's risk include chronic high blood pressure or kidney disease before pregnancy, obesity, age  over 40, being pregnant with more than one fetus, African American ethnicity, family history of preeclampsia. Preeclampsia is also more common among women who have histories of certain health conditions, such as migraines, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, scleroderma, urinary tract infections, gum disease, polycystic ovary syndrome, multiple sclerosis, gestational diabetes, and sickle cell disease. Preeclampsia is also more common in pregnancies resulting from egg donation, donor insemination, or in vitro fertilization. If you are at very high risk of preeclampsia, your doctor may recommend that you start taking low-dose aspirin after at least 12 weeks of pregnancy. Visit your health care provider for a preconception visit to discuss what you can do to lower your risk. Your health care provider may recommend ways to control your blood pressure, if needed, by limiting your salt intake, exercising regularly, and losing weight if you are overweight. If you take medication to control your blood pressure, ask your health care provider if you should change it. Some medications should not be used during pregnancy. Get regular prenatal care, including regular blood pressure checks, urine tests for protein, as well as regular weight checks. Avoid alcohol and tobacco.

Early signs of DMD may include delayed ability to sit, stand, or walk and difficulties learning to speak. Muscle weakness is usually noticeable by 3 or 4 years of age and begins in the hips, pelvic area, upper legs, and shoulders. DMD may also affect learning and memory, as well as communication and certain social emotional skills.  Muscle weakness worsens with age and progresses to the arms, legs and trunk. Most children with DMD use a wheelchair full time by age 13. Heart and respiratory muscle problems begin in the teen years and lead to serious, life threatening complications.

The defect makes it hard for the body to distribute copper in food from the intestines into the bloodstream for use in other areas. As a result, the brain and other parts of the body do not get enough copper. Copper can build up in the small intestine and kidneys, but low copper levels in other areas can affect the structure of bone, skin, hair, and blood vessels, and interfere with nerve function. Menkes syndrome is inherited, which means it runs in families. There is often a history of Menkes syndrome in a male relative. Symptoms of Menkes syndrome are bone spurs, brittle, kinky hair, feeding difficulties, irritability, lack of muscle tone, floppiness, low body temperature, mental deterioration, pudgy, rosy cheeks, seizures, skeletal changes, abnormal appearance of the hair, abnormally low body temperature, bleeding in the brain. slow growth in the womb.

For people with more severe hemophilia, preventative treatments should be given. Mild hemophilia may be treated with desmopressin (DDAVP). This medicine helps the body release factor VIII that is stored within the lining of blood vessels.",
      "prediction": "Hemophilia A is a hereditary bleeding disorder caused by a lack of blood clotting factor VIII. Without enough factor VIII, the blood cannot clot properly to control bleeding. Causes When you bleed, a series of reactions take place in the body that helps blood clots form. This process is called the coagulation cascade. It involves special proteins called coagulation, or clotting, factors. You may have a higher chance of excess bleeding if one or more of these factors are missing or are not functioning like they should. Factor VIII (eight) is one such coagulation factor. Hemophilia A is the result of the body not making enough factor VIII. Hemophilia A is caused by an inherited X-linked recessive trait, with the defective gene located on the X chromosome. Females have two copies of the X chromosome. So if the factor VIII gene on one chromosome does not work, the gene on the other chromosome can do the job of making enough factor VIII. Males have only one X chromosome. If the factor VIII gene is missing on a boy's X chromosome, he will have hemophilia A. For this reason, most people with hemophilia A are male. If a woman has a defective factor VIII gene, she is considered a carrier. This means the defective gene can be passed down to her children"

      "reference": "The cause of PCOS is unknown, but probably involves a combination of genetic and environmental factors",
      "prediction": "Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a hormonal disorder that affects women of reproductive age. It is characterized by the presence of multiple small cysts on the ovaries, irregular menstrual cycles, and excess androgen production. PCOS can cause a range of symptoms, including acne, hair growth, and weight gain. It can also increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Treatment for PCOS typically involves lifestyle changes, such as weight loss and exercise, as well as medication to regulate hormones and reduce symptoms. It is important to seek medical advice if you suspect you have PCOS, as it can have a significant impact on your health and well-being."

It is characterized by dwarfism, limited range of motion at the elbows, large head size, small fingers, and normal intelligence. Achondroplasia can cause health complications such as apnea, obesity, recurrent ear infections, and lordosis of the spine. Achondroplasia is caused by mutations in the FGFR3 gene. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion.",
      "prediction": "Achondroplasia is a genetic disorder that causes short stature. It is caused by a mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene. The mutation causes the FGFR3 protein to be overactive, which leads to abnormal bone growth. Achondroplasia is the most common form of dwarfism, affecting about 1 in 15,000 people. The disorder is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, meaning that a child of a parent with achondroplasia has a 50% chance of inheriting the disorder. Achondroplasia is characterized by short stature, short arms and legs, and a large head. The disorder can also cause other problems, such as hearing loss, spinal stenosis, and intellectual disability. Treatment for achondroplasia typically involves surgery to correct the deformities and physical therapy to improve mobility. There is no cure for achondroplasia, but treatments can help improve the quality of life for those affected.\n\n### Reference:\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK470351/"

      "reference": "Glaucoma can damage the optic nerve due to increased pressure in the eye. Adults may have open-angle glaucoma, angle-closure glaucoma, also called closed-angle glaucoma or secondary glaucoma.  Open-angle glaucoma occurs due to slow increase in eye pressure over time, and is the most common type of glaucoma. Its cause is unknown, but it tends to run in the families. Closed-angle glaucoma occurs due to a quick, severe rise in eye pressure. Dilating eye drops and certain medicines may trigger an acute glaucoma attack.  Secondary glaucoma occurs due to a known cause. Both open- and closed-angle glaucoma can be secondary when caused by something known. Causes include: drugs such as corticosteroids, eye diseases such as uveitis, diabetes, eye injury. Most people cannot feel open-angle glaucoma. People may experience blind spots and slow loss of side (peripheral) vision (also called tunnel vision). Symptoms of closed-angle glaucoma may come and go at first, or steadily become worse. You may notice: sudden, severe pain in one eye decreased or cloudy vision, nausea and vomiting, rainbow-like halos around lights, red eye, feeling that an eye is swollen. The only way to diagnose glaucoma is by having a complete eye exam. You will be given a test to check your eye pressure (tonometry.)  Eye pressure can be normal in some people with glaucoma. So you will need other tests to confirm glaucoma. They may include: using a special lens to look at the angle of the eye (gonioscopy), optic nerve imaging, checking your visual acuity, field of vision, retina and how your pupil responds to light (pupillary reflex response), 3-D view of your eye (slit lamp examination). The goal of treatment is to reduce your eye pressure. Treatment depends on the type of glaucoma that you have.  If you have open-angle glaucoma, you will probably be given eye drops. You also may be given pills to lower pressure in the eye. If drops alone do not work, you may need laser treatment that uses a painless laser to open the channels for fluid  to flow out.  If drops and laser treatment do not work, you may need surgery. The doctor will open a new channel so fluid can escape. This will help lower your pressure. Recently, new implants have been developed that can help treat glaucoma in people having cataract surgery. An acute angle-closure attack is a medical emergency. If you have had acute glaucoma in one eye, your doctor is likely to treat your second eye to prevent an attack in that eye.You can become blind in a few days if you are not treated. You may be given drops, pills, and IV medicine to lower your eye pressure. Some people also need an emergency operation, called an iridotomy.  If you have secondary glaucoma, treating the cause may help your symptoms go away. Other treatments also may be needed. Open-angle glaucoma cannot be cured. You can manage it and keep your sight by following your provider's directions.  You cannot prevent open-angle glaucoma, but you can help prevent vision loss. A complete eye exam can help find open-angle glaucoma early, when it is easier to treat. All adults should have a complete eye exam by the age of 40. You should have regular eye exams as recommended by your provider. If you are at risk for closed-angle glaucoma, your provider may recommend treatment before you have an attack to help prevent eye damage and vision loss.",
