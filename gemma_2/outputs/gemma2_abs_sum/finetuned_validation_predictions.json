      "reference": "Dizziness has many possible causes, including inner ear disturbance, motion sickness, medication effects, and underlying health condition, such as poor circulation, infection or injury. How long the dizziness lasts and makes you feel, its triggers and other symptoms may help  determine its cause. Your sense of balance depends on the combined input from your eyes, which help you determine where your body is in space and how it's moving; sensory nerves, which send messages to your brain about body movements and positions, and inner ear, which detects gravity and back-and-forth motion Vertigo (dizziness) is the false sense that your surroundings are spinning or moving, which happens when your brain receives signals from the inner ear that aren't consistent with what your eyes and sensory nerves are receiving. Vertigo is what results as your brain works to sort out the confusion.",

Lifestyle and home remedies To help you feel more secure and prevent falls, make sure someone else does these tasks around your home: - Remove throw rugs and clutter from the floor. - Place nightlights on so you won't bump into furniture or walls. - Add handrails to stairs. - Install grab bars in bathrooms. You can take these steps to reduce dizziness and promote balance: - Take water pills (diuretics) as directed if you have Meniere's disease. - Take antihistamines such as meclizine (Antivert) as directed for vertigo. - If your doctor prescribes them, wear scopolamine (Transderm Scop) skin patches as directed to reduce dizziness. - If your doctor prescribes them, take the anti-nausea medications prochlorperazine (Compro) or diphenhydramine (Benadryl) as directed. These drugs may cause drowsiness. - If your doctor prescribes them, take diazepam (Valium) as directed to reduce dizziness. - Avoid alcohol while taking anti-nausea medications. - Ask your doctor about taking magnesium supplements. - Ask your doctor about getting regular exercise.

      "prediction": "Macular degeneration, or age-related macular degeneration (AMD), is a leading cause of vision loss in Americans 60 and older. It is a disease that destroys your sharp, central vision. You need central vision to see objects clearly and to do tasks such as reading and driving. AMD affects the macula, the part of the eye that allows you to see fine detail. It does not hurt, but it causes cells in the macula to die. There are two types: wet and dry. Wet AMD happens when abnormal blood vessels grow under the macula. These new blood vessels often leak blood and fluid. Wet AMD damages the macula quickly. Blurred vision is a common early symptom. Dry AMD happens when the light-sensitive cells in the macula slowly break down. Your gradually lose your central vision. A common early symptom is that straight lines appear crooked. Regular comprehensive eye exams can detect macular degeneration before the disease causes vision loss. Treatment can slow vision loss. It does not restore vision."

Childhood cerebral form  appears at ages 4 to 8. Its symptoms include changes in muscle tone, muscle spasms and uncontrolled movements, crossed eyes, difficulty at school, difficulty understanding what people are saying, hearing loss, and hyperactivity. Worsening nervous system damage, may include coma, decreased fine motor control, and paralysis, seizures, swallowing difficulties, visual impairment or blindness.  A long-term coma (vegetative state) could start about 2 years after nervous system symptoms develop and last as long as 10 years, until death occurs.

      "reference": "SLC4A1-associated distal renal tubular acidosis is a kidney (renal) disorder that sometimes includes blood cell abnormalities. The kidneys normally filter fluid and waste products from the body and remove them in urine. in people with distal renal tubular acidosis, the kidneys are unable to remove enough acid from the body, and the blood becomes too acidic. This chemical imbalance is called metabolic acidosis. The inability to remove acids from the body often results in slowed growth and may also lead to softening and weakening of the bones, called rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults. This bone disorder is characterized by bone pain, bowed legs, and difficulty walking. In addition, most children and adults with SLC4A1-associated distal renal tubular acidosis have excess calcium in the urine (hypercalciuria), calcium deposits in the kidneys (nephrocalcinosis), and kidney stones (nephrolithiasis). In rare cases, these kidney abnormalities lead to life-threatening kidney failure. Affected individuals may also have low levels of potassium in the blood (hypokalemia). Individuals with the features described above have complete distal renal tubular acidosis, which usually becomes apparent in childhood. Some people do not develop metabolic acidosis even though their kidneys have trouble removing acids; these individuals are said to have incomplete distal renal tubular acidosis. Additionally, these individuals may have other features of distal renal tubular acidosis, such as bone problems and kidney stones. Often, people who initially have incomplete distal renal tubular acidosis develop metabolic acidosis later in life. Some people with SLC4A1-associated distal renal tubular acidosis also have blood cell abnormalities. These can vary in severity from no symptoms to a condition called hemolytic anemia, in which red blood cells prematurely break down (undergo hemolysis), causing a shortage of red blood cells (anemia). Hemolytic anemia can lead to unusually pale skin (pallor), extreme tiredness (fatigue), shortness of breath (dyspnea), and an enlarged spleen (splenomegaly). There are two forms of SLC4A1-associated distal renal tubular acidosis; they are distinguished by their inheritance pattern. The autosomal dominant form is more common and is usually less severe than the autosomal recessive form. The autosomal dominant form can be associated with incomplete or complete distal renal tubular acidosis and is rarely associated with blood cell abnormalities. The autosomal recessive form is always associated with complete distal renal tubular acidosis and is more commonly associated with blood cell abnormalities, although not everyone with this form has abnormal blood cells.",

Another common type of dementia is vascular dementia. It is caused by poor blood flow to the brain, such as with stroke. Lewy body disease is a common cause of dementia in older adults. People with this condition have abnormal protein structures in certain areas of the brain. The following medical conditions can also lead to dementia: Huntington disease Brain injury Multiple sclerosis Infections such as HIV/AIDS, syphilis, and Lyme disease Parkinson disease Pick disease Progressive supranuclear palsy Some causes of dementia may be stopped or reversed if they are found soon enough, including: Brain injury Brain tumors Chronic alcohol abuse Changes in blood sugar, sodium, and calcium levels (dementia due to metabolic causes) Low vitamin B12 level Dementia symptoms include difficulty with many areas of mental function, including emotional behavior or personality, language, memory, perception, and thinking and judgment. Dementia usually first appears as forgetfulness. Mild cognitive impairment"

Treatment Treatment can be challenging, and there's no cure for dementia. The goal of treatment is to help you function safely and independently as long as possible. Treatment depends on the type of dementia and its severity. You and your family might try the following approaches: - Create a care plan. A care plan might include information about your home, finances, insurance, durable medical equipment, prescriptions, medical providers, emergency contacts, and important documents, such as birth certificates, social security cards and marriage licenses.

If blisters break, gently clean the area with mild soap and water, apply an antibiotic ointment, and cover it with a nonstick gauze bandage. - Apply moisturizer or aloe vera lotion or gel.
