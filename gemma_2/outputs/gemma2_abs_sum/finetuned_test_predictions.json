      "question": "Psoriasis for past 7-8 years I had psoriasis on my scalp for nearly 10 years. Please give suggestions and medications.",
      "reference": "Psoriasis treatments reduce inflammation and clear the skin. Treatments can be divided into three main types: topical treatments, light therapy and systemic medications. Topical psoriasis treatments for mild to moderate psoriasis include corticosteroids as a short-term treatment during flares; creams or solutions containing vitamin D; anthralin to slow skin cell growth. Anthralin (Dritho-Scalp) can also remove scales and make skin smoother. But anthralin can irritate skin, and it stains almost anything it touches. It's usually applied for a short time and then washed off. Topical retinoids are vitamin A derivatives that may decrease inflammation, but also increase sensitivity to sunlight, which requires applying sunscreen before going outdoors. Calcineurin inhibitors tacrolimus (Prograf) and pimecrolimus (Elidel) reduce inflammation and plaque buildup.  Salicylic acid promotes sloughing of dead skin cells and reduces scaling. Sometimes it's combined with other medications, such as topical corticosteroids or coal tar, to increase its effectiveness. Salicylic acid is available in medicated shampoos and scalp solutions to treat scalp psoriasis. Coal tar reduces scaling, itching and inflammation. It is available in over-the-counter shampoos, creams and oils.  Coal tar can irritate the skin, has a strong odor and stains clothing and bedding.  Light therapy (phototherapy) uses natural sunlight or artificial ultraviolet light A (UVA) or ultraviolet B (UVB) light.  Some doctors combine UVB treatment and coal tar treatment, which is known as Goeckerman treatment.  Psoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA) involves taking a light-sensitizing medication (psoralen) before exposure to UVA light.   For severe psoriasis or psoriasis resistant to other types of treatment, your doctor may prescribe oral or injected drugs. This is known as systemic treatment. Because of severe side effects, some of these medications are used for only brief periods and may be alternated with other forms of treatment. These drugs include retinoids; methotrexate (Rheumatrex) that helps psoriasis by decreasing the production of skin cells and suppressing inflammation; cyclosporine (Gengraf, Neoral) that suppresses the immune system and is similar to methotrexate in effectiveness, but can only be taken short-term.  Drugs that alter the immune system (biologics) include etanercept (Enbrel), infliximab (Remicade), adalimumab (Humira), ustekinumab (Stelara), golimumab (Simponi), apremilast (Otezla), secukinumab (Cosentyx) and ixekizumab (Taltz). Most of these drugs are given by injection (apremilast is oral) and are usually used for people who have failed to respond to traditional therapy or who have associated psoriatic arthritis. Biologics must be used with caution because they have strong effects on the immune system and may permit life-threatening infections.  Thioguanine (Tabloid) and hydroxyurea (Droxia, Hydrea) are medications that can be used when other drugs can't be given.  A number of alternative therapies to ease the symptoms of psoriasis, including special diets, creams, dietary supplements and herbs, are deemed generally safe, and they may be helpful to some people in reducing signs and symptoms, such as itching and scaling.  Alternative therapies include aloe vera that may reduce redness, scaling, itching and inflammation; fish oil to reduce inflammation. Taking 3 grams or less of fish oil daily is generally recognized as safe, and you may find it beneficial. Oregon grape (barberry) may reduce inflammation and ease psoriasis symptoms.  Other measures that may help include daily baths to remove scales and calm inflamed skin. Add bath oil, colloidal oatmeal, Epsom salts or Dead Sea salts to the water and soak. Avoid hot water and harsh soaps, which can worsen symptoms; use lukewarm water and mild soaps that have added oils and fats. Soak about 10 minutes then gently pat dry skin. Use moisturizer. Expose your skin to small amounts of sunlight. Find out what triggers, if any, worsen your psoriasis and take steps to prevent or avoid them. Infections, injuries to your skin, stress, smoking and intense sun exposure can all worsen psoriasis. Avoid drinking alcohol.  If you do drink, keep it moderate.",

Tar is an ingredient in prescription and over-the-counter ointments and creams that can be drying and irritating. Tar can be used on most areas of the body except the face. Tar is combined with other ingredients, such as corticosteroids or salicylic acid, to make it more effective. Tar preparations may stain clothing and linens. - Corticosteroid injections.

The skin on the elbows, knees, scalp, back, face, palms and feet is most often affected, but other parts of the body can be affected as well. A problem with the immune system causes psoriasis. In a process called cell turnover, skin cells that grow deep in the skin rise to the surface. Normally, this takes a month. In psoriasis, it happens in just days because the cells rise too fast. Although symptoms may come and go, for many, psoriasis is a lifelong condition. Infections, stress, dry skin and certain medications may make symptoms worse."

People affected by this condition may experience a variety of symptoms such as changes in alertness and attention; hallucinations; problems with movement and posture; muscle stiffness; confusion; and/or memory loss. Although the exact cause of Lewy body dementia is poorly understood, symptoms are thought to result when clumps of a protein called alpha-synuclein (\"Lewy bodies\") accumulate in the brain. Lewy body dementia usually occurs sporadically in people with no family history of the condition. Rarely, more than one family member may be affected.  Studies of these families suggest that there may be a genetic component to the condition in some cases. Some of these cases appear to be due to single gene mutations that follow an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance.

      "reference": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a progressive form of muscular dystrophy that occurs primarily in males, though in rare cases may affect females. Early signs of DMD may include delayed ability to sit, stand, or walk and difficulties learning to speak. Muscle weakness is usually noticeable by 3 or 4 years of age and begins in the hips, pelvic area, upper legs, and shoulders. DMD may also affect learning and memory, as well as communication and certain social emotional skills.  Muscle weakness worsens with age and progresses to the arms, legs and trunk. Most children with DMD use a wheelchair full time by age 13. Heart and respiratory muscle problems begin in the teen years and lead to serious, life threatening complications. DMD is caused by mutations in the DMD gene, which are inherited in an X-linked recessive  pattern. DMD may also occur in people who do not have a family history of the disease. While there is no known cure for DMD, there are treatments that can help control symptoms. and complications caused by severe progressive muscle weakness. An enlarged, weakened heart may be treated with medications, but in severe cases a  heart transplant may be necessary. Assistive devices for breathing difficulties may be needed, especially at night and as the disease progresses. Steroids may improve the strength and function of muscles in people with DMD, including lung function.   Due to the advancement of medical treatment, boys with DMD may now live into young adulthood.",

If the other X chromosome does not have a genetic change that causes DMD, the female will be a carrier. Females with two copies of the X chromosome with genetic changes that cause DMD may have a milder form of the disease, or only have one copy of the genetic change.

      "prediction": "Mutations in several genes cause autosomal recessive congenital stationary night blindness. Each of these genes provide instructions for making proteins that are found in the retina. These proteins are involved in sending (transmitting) visual signals from cells called rods, which are specialized for vision in low light, to cells called bipolar cells, which relay the signals to other retinal cells. This signaling is an essential step in the transmission of visual information from the eyes to the brain. Mutations in two genes, GRM6 and TRPM1, cause most cases of this condition. These genes provide instructions for making proteins that are necessary for bipolar cells to receive and relay signals. Mutations in other genes involved in the same bipolar cell signaling pathway are likely responsible for a small percentage of cases of autosomal recessive congenital stationary night blindness. Gene mutations that cause autosomal recessive congenital stationary night blindness disrupt the transmission of visual signals between rod cells and bipolar cells or interfere with the bipolar cells' ability to pass on these signals. As a result, visual information received by rod cells cannot be effectively transmitted to the brain, leading to difficulty seeing in low light.

      "reference": "Glaucoma can damage the optic nerve due to increased pressure in the eye. Adults may have open-angle glaucoma, angle-closure glaucoma, also called closed-angle glaucoma or secondary glaucoma.  Open-angle glaucoma occurs due to slow increase in eye pressure over time, and is the most common type of glaucoma. Its cause is unknown, but it tends to run in the families. Closed-angle glaucoma occurs due to a quick, severe rise in eye pressure. Dilating eye drops and certain medicines may trigger an acute glaucoma attack.  Secondary glaucoma occurs due to a known cause. Both open- and closed-angle glaucoma can be secondary when caused by something known. Causes include: drugs such as corticosteroids, eye diseases such as uveitis, diabetes, eye injury. Most people cannot feel open-angle glaucoma. People may experience blind spots and slow loss of side (peripheral) vision (also called tunnel vision). Symptoms of closed-angle glaucoma may come and go at first, or steadily become worse. You may notice: sudden, severe pain in one eye decreased or cloudy vision, nausea and vomiting, rainbow-like halos around lights, red eye, feeling that an eye is swollen. The only way to diagnose glaucoma is by having a complete eye exam. You will be given a test to check your eye pressure (tonometry.)  Eye pressure can be normal in some people with glaucoma. So you will need other tests to confirm glaucoma. They may include: using a special lens to look at the angle of the eye (gonioscopy), optic nerve imaging, checking your visual acuity, field of vision, retina and how your pupil responds to light (pupillary reflex response), 3-D view of your eye (slit lamp examination). The goal of treatment is to reduce your eye pressure. Treatment depends on the type of glaucoma that you have.  If you have open-angle glaucoma, you will probably be given eye drops. You also may be given pills to lower pressure in the eye. If drops alone do not work, you may need laser treatment that uses a painless laser to open the channels for fluid  to flow out.  If drops and laser treatment do not work, you may need surgery. The doctor will open a new channel so fluid can escape. This will help lower your pressure. Recently, new implants have been developed that can help treat glaucoma in people having cataract surgery. An acute angle-closure attack is a medical emergency. If you have had acute glaucoma in one eye, your doctor is likely to treat your second eye to prevent an attack in that eye.You can become blind in a few days if you are not treated. You may be given drops, pills, and IV medicine to lower your eye pressure. Some people also need an emergency operation, called an iridotomy.  If you have secondary glaucoma, treating the cause may help your symptoms go away. Other treatments also may be needed. Open-angle glaucoma cannot be cured. You can manage it and keep your sight by following your provider's directions.  You cannot prevent open-angle glaucoma, but you can help prevent vision loss. A complete eye exam can help find open-angle glaucoma early, when it is easier to treat. All adults should have a complete eye exam by the age of 40. You should have regular eye exams as recommended by your provider. If you are at risk for closed-angle glaucoma, your provider may recommend treatment before you have an attack to help prevent eye damage and vision loss.",

      "reference": "Open-angle glaucoma occurs due to slow increase in eye pressure over time, and is the most common type of glaucoma. Its cause is unknown, but it tends to run in the families. Most people cannot feel open-angle glaucoma. Closed-angle glaucoma occurs due to a quick, severe rise in eye pressure. Dilating eye drops and certain medicines may trigger an acute glaucoma attack.  Secondary glaucoma occurs due to a known cause. Both open- and closed-angle glaucoma can be secondary when caused by something known. Causes include: drugs such as corticosteroids, eye diseases such as uveitis, diabetes, eye injury.",

      "prediction": "up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography. - Positron emission tomography (PET): A procedure that uses a special camera to make a detailed picture of active areas in the body. A small amount of radioactive glucose is injected into a vein. Glucose is a sugar that the body needs to stay healthy. Active cancer cells need glucose to grow and survive. The radioactive glucose collects in the active cancer cells and is detected by the PET camera. The patient lies on a table that slides into the tunnel. The radioactive glucose is injected into a vein. The radioactive glucose collects in the active cancer cells and is detected by the PET camera. - Prostatic specific antigen (P-PSA): A test that measures the level of P-PSA in the blood. P-PSA is a substance made by the prostate. It may be found in increased amounts in the blood of men who have prostate cancer. P-PSA levels may also be high in men who have an infection or inflammation of the prostate or BPH (an enlarged, but noncancerous, prostate). The following stages are used for prostate cancer: - Stage I - Stage II - Stage III - Stage IV Stage I cancer is cancer that has just been diagnosed and has not spread outside the prostate.

      "reference": "Placing radioactive seeds inside the prostate gland (brachytherapy) is often used for small prostate cancers that are found early and are slow-growing. Brachytherapy may be combined with external beam radiation therapy for more advanced cancers.  A surgeon inserts small needles through the skin beneath the scrotum to inject small seeds that you do not feel. The seeds are left in place permanently. Side effects may include pain, swelling, or bruising in the penis or scrotum; red-brown urine or semen; impotence; incontinence, urinary retention, diarrhea.",
      "prediction": "Radical prostatectomy is a surgery to remove the prostate and some of the surrounding tissue. It is an option when the cancer has not spread beyond the prostate gland. Radiation therapy works best for treating prostate cancer that has not spread outside of the prostate. It may also be used after surgery if there is a risk that cancer cells are still present. Radiation is sometimes used for pain relief when cancer has spread to the bone."

      "question": "how do you test for cholesterol level in your body",
      "reference": "A blood test for cholesterol levels typically reports total cholesterol level, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides. For the best measurements, don't drink or eat anything other than water for nine to twelve hours before the blood sample is taken.",
      "prediction": "other foods, can raise your LDL cholesterol and lower your HDL cholesterol. - Limit cholesterol. Foods that are high in cholesterol, such as eggs, shellfish and organ meats, will increase your total cholesterol. But these foods aren't the main contributors to high cholesterol. - Balance carbohydrates. Carbohydrates are broken down into sugar, which is released into the bloodstream. Your body needs sugar for energy. But too much sugar in the blood can cause insulin levels to rise. Insulin helps move sugar from the bloodstream into cells where it's used as an energy source. If sugar levels become too high or insulin levels become too low, fat is stored instead of burned for energy. If you have high cholesterol, limit foods that cause a rapid rise in blood sugar levels. This includes foods that are high in saturated fat and trans fat, such as baked goods, fast foods and fried foods. Eat more fiber to help lower cholesterol. Eating about 25 to 30 grams of fiber a day can help lower your total cholesterol by about 10 percent. Fiber-rich foods include beans and peas, whole grains, nuts and seeds. Be aware that some studies have found that eating 1 to 2 egg whites a day doesn't raise total cholesterol or LDL cholesterol as much"
